0) If for some reason you are insane and like to run Windows as a roboticist, install Python2 or Python3 (It is 2020, so you might as well get on with the times and use Python3).
1) Install PIP, the python package installer, if you do not already have it:
	- Ubuntu: "sudo apt install python3-pip"
	- Windows or other: Run the script on: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
2) Install the dependencies for this project using pip, by running "pip install --user <module-name>" (or pip3, if using Python3), where <module-name> is:
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
3) Download and unzip "pydmp_exercise.zip".	
4) See the comments in the file "main.py" for a description of what you should implement in the exercise.
5) Run "main.py" and rejoice in the great beauty of Dynamic Movement Primitives.
